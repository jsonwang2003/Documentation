# String

A **string** is a sequence of characters used to represent text. It is one of the most fundamental data types in programming and is typically enclosed in quotes.

## Properties

- Immutable in many languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), meaning once created, it cannot be changed
- Indexed: each character has a position starting from 0
- Can contain letters, digits, symbols, and whitespace

## Common Operations

- **Concatenation**: Combine two or more strings (`"Hello" + "World"` → `"HelloWorld"`)
- **Substring**: Extract part of a string (`"Hello"[1:4]` → `"ell"`)
- **Search**: Find characters or patterns (`"apple".find("p")` → `1`)
- **Replace**: Substitute characters or substrings (`"cat".replace("c", "b")` → `"bat"`)
- **Length**: Count number of characters (`len("hello")` → `5`)
