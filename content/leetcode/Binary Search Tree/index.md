# Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure where each node has the following properties:

## Properties
- The left subtree contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key
- The right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
- Both left and right subtrees are also binary search trees

## Common Operations
- Search: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
- Insert: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case  
- Delete: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
