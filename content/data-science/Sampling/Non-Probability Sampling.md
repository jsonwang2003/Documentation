# Non-Probability Sampling
> [!INFO]
> random selection is not performed, not all individuals can be selected

- Types of non-probability sampling
## Convenience method

- individuals who are **readily available to the researcher** are part of the sample
- **easy**, **quick**, and **cheaper** way of obtaining data
- Example
	- professor could ask students to complete survey right after lecture
	- most convenient way to gather information from all attendees
## Voluntary Sampling Method

- **people volunteer to participate in the survey** instead of the researcher selecting the participants
- Example
	- news reporter asked viewers to go to the news channel website and fill out an online survey
## Purposive Method

- researcher selects respondents who are specific to the topic of research
- Example
	- researcher wants to know how the university treats disabled students
	- only select students with disabilities to fill out the survey

## Snowball Method

- used when **finding respondents is difficult**
- ***in this case*** one respondent helps the researcher to get in touch with more individuals who can help in the survey
- Example
	- researcher needs to find out the issues that homeless people undergo
	- find 1 individual who can put them in touch with several other homeless people
