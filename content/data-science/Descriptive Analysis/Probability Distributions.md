# Probability
- the estimation of the likelihood of an event outcome will occur
- represented as a percentage or decimal point
- Factors may influence probability

# Probability Distributions
- describe how values of a random variable are distributed, providing a mathematical framework for understanding uncertainty in data
- these distributions are fundamental in statistical analysis, enabling
	- predictions
	- hypothesis testing
	- decision-making

# Discrete Data

- can take only specified values
## Binomial Distribution

- Describes variables with 2 possible outcomes
- the probability distributions of the number of successes in n trials with probability of success

## Discrete Uniform Distribution

- Describes events that have equal probabilities

## Poisson Distribution

- Describes count data
- gives the probability of an event happening a certain number of times within a given interval of time / space

# Continuous Data

- can take any value within a given range
	- the range can be finite or infinite

## Normal Distribution

- Describes data with values that become less probable that farther they are from the average (mean)
- bell-shaped probability density function

## Continuous Uniform Distribution

- Describes data for which equal-sized intervals (space between data) have equal probability

## Log-Normal Distribution

- Describes right-skewed data, which is the probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed

## Exponential Distribution

- Describes data that has higher probabilities for small values then large values
- The probability distribution of time between independent events
