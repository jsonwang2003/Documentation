# Probability Sampling

> [!INFO]
> every individual from the population has a chance of being selected as part of the sample

- gives a result that is more indicative of the whole group
- Types of probability sampling
## Simple Random Method

- every individual from the group has an equal chance of being selected in the sample
- Example:
	- Rolling a Dice
	- chance of rolling a 4 is $\frac{1}{6}$
## Systematic Method

- individuals are assigned numbers, and are selected based on the numbers at regular intervals
- Example:
	- Employees of a company are lined up in the order of the alphabet
	- every 10th person is selected starting from 6th employee
	- sample: 6th, 16th, 26th, etc.
## Stratified Method

- individuals are divided into strata or subgroups based on certain criteria (gender, age, income, profession, etc.)
- Ensures that there is a representation from each of the subgroups in the sample
- Example:
	- 100 female and 50 male employees
	- wants to find gender ratio
	- divide the employees into 2 subgroups based on gender
	- sample: around 50 female and 25 male
## Cluster Method

- involves dividing the group into subgroups
- the whole subgroup is selected at random
- Example
	- several offices around the country with a similar number of employees in each office
	- Instead of going to each office, only 3-4 offices are selected randomly to get the desired result
