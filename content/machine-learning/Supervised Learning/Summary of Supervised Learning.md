	- medical diagnosis
	- sentiment analysis
- can be
	- **binary**: predict whether an email is spam or not
	- **multiclass**: classifying handwritten digits into ten categories
	- **multi-label**: identifying multiple objects in an image

# Ordinal Regression

- supervised learning approach that **combines elements of both classification and regression by predicting ordered categorical outcomes**
- takes into account the **meaningful ranking of categories**
	- have inherent order but no precise numerical difference between them
		- traditional classification models are not well suited for such tasks
		- specialized models are used
			- Ordinal Logistic Regression
			- [[machine-learning/Supervised Learning/Classification Models|Gradient Boosting Methods]]
			- Neural Networks with ranking loss functions
- model evaluated using metrics to measure their effectiveness in **preserving the ordinal structure in predictions**
	- Spearman's rank correlation
	- mean squared error of ranks

# Survival Analysis

- specialized branch of supervised learning used to **predict time-to-event data**
	- estimating time until patient's recovery
	- equipment failure
	- customer churn
- accounts for **censored data, where the event of interest may not have occurred for all observations during the study period**

- Evaluation Metrics
	- Concordance index (C-index)
	- Log-Rank Test

# Anomaly Detection

- identifying **rare or unexpected patterns** based on labeled data
- widely used in fraud detection, cybersecurity threat identification, and predictive maintenance
