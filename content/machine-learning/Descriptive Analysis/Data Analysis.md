> transformation of data into information

- ## Descriptive Analytics
	- Summarizing of raw data by converting it into a form that can be easily understood
	- commonly used to describe in detail about an event in the past
	- used to derive trends and patterns or outcomes

- ## Diagnostic Analytics
	- advanced method of descriptive analysis which uses statistical analysis to derive conclusions from data
	- uses statistical techniques to uncover and identify relationships, associativity, influences, and/or differences between variables

- ## Predictive Analytics
	- uses advanced statistical processes to forecast trends based on historical and current events and variables
	- uses range of data modeling processes to predict the probability of an occurrence / event and draw attention of the combination of variables that **influence**, **impact**, or **lead** to the outcome

- ## Prescriptive Analytics
	- uses real-time data to inform and recalibrate recommendations based on a set of self-learning algorithms
	- developed through using continuous data feeds, advanced data modeling, and machine learning techniques

- ## Cognitive Analytics
	- applies human-like intelligence to certain tasks and brings together a number of intelligent technologies
		- semantics
		- artificial intelligence algorithms
		- deep learning
		- machine learning
