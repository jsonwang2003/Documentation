# Machine Learning

Welcome to my Machine Learning notes and concepts.

## Topics
- [[Data Science/index|Intro to Data Science]] - The interdisciplinary field that extracts insights and knowledge from data using **statistics**, **programming**, and **domain expertise**.
- [[Descriptive Analysis/index|Descriptive Analysis]] - Summarizing and presenting data through measures like **mean** and **standard deviation**.
- [[Data Visualization/index|Data Visualization]] - Transforms raw data into graphical formats like **charts** and **maps**, making complex information easier to understand, explore, and communicate.
- [[Statistical Inference/index|Statistical Inference]] - Fundamental aspect of data science that enables researchers to draw meaningful conclusions from data by **utilizing probabilistic frameworks**.
- [[Sampling/index|Sampling]] - the process of selecting a subset of data **from a larger population** to *make inferences* or *analyze trends* **without examining the entire group**.
- [[Regression Analysis/index|Regression Analysis]] - A statistical method used to model and examine the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable, helping predict outcomes and uncover trends.
- [[Linear Regression]] - Fundamental regression technique
- [[Neural Networks]] - Deep learning fundamentals
