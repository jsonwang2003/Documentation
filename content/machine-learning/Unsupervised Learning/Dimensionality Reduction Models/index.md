> **Dimensionality Reduction** is a technique used to reduce the number of input variables in a dataset while preserving its essential structure. It simplifies high-dimensional data, improves model performance, and enhances interpretability. Dimensionality reduction is foundational in preprocessing pipelines, visualization, and noise reduction.

## Overview

Dimensionality reduction transforms data from a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one, making it easier to analyze and visualize. It is especially useful when dealing with datasets that contain many correlated or redundant features.

Key tasks include:

- Removing irrelevant or redundant features
- Preserving meaningful structure in fewer dimensions
- Enhancing model performance and generalization
- Improving visualization of complex datasets
- Reducing computational cost and overfitting risk

These techniques are widely used in **natural language processing**, **image compression**, **bioinformatics**, and **recommendation systems**.

## Included Algorithms

- ### [[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)]]
> Projects data onto orthogonal components that capture maximum variance. Fast and widely used, but assumes linear relationships.

- ### [[t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)]]
> Non-linear technique for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D. Preserves local structure but not global distances.

- ### [[Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)]]
> Preserves both local and global structure. Faster than t-SNE and effective for visualization and clustering prep.

- ### [[Independent Component Analysis (ICA)]]
> Separates multivariate signals into statistically independent components. Effective for blind source separation and uncovering latent factors.

- ### [[Feature Selection Techniques]]
> Includes methods like variance thresholding, mutual information, and recursive feature elimination. Focuses on selecting informative features rather than transforming them.

## Key Concepts

- **Variance**: Measure of spread captured by each component
- **Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues**: Core to PCA and spectral methods
- **Manifold Learning**: Assumes data lies on a lower-dimensional manifold
- **Reconstruction Error**: Difference between original and reduced data
- **Local vs Global Structure**: Trade-off in preserving neighborhood relationships
