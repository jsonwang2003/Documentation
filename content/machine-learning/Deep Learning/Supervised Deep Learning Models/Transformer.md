> A **sequence model** leveraging **self-attention mechanisms** for parallelized language understanding.

- Dominates NLP tasks with scalable architecture and contextual weighting
## Components

- **Self-Attention Layers**: Weigh relationships between tokens
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds order information to input sequences
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Captures diverse contextual views
- **Feedforward Layers**: Refine attention outputs
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training
## Key Features

1. **Contextual Attention**
	- Dynamically focuses on relevant parts of input
2. **Parallel Processing**
	- Enables faster training than RNNs
3. **Scalability**
	- Handles large datasets and long sequences
4. **Transfer Learning Friendly**
	- Powers pre-trained models like BERT and GPT
## Business Applications

- **Customer Service Automation**
	- Powers chatbots with intent recognition
- **Contract Analysis**
	- Extracts clauses and compliance risks from legal docs
- **Sentiment Monitoring**
	- Analyzes social media for brand perception
- **Marketing Intelligence**
	- Informs campaigns with real-time sentiment data
