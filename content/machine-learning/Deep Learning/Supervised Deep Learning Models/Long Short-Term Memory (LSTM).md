> A **specialized RNN variant** designed to capture **long-range dependencies** in sequential data.

- Solves vanishing gradient issues with gated memory units
## Components

- **Input Gate**: Controls which new information enters memory
- **Forget Gate**: Decides what to discard from memory
- **Output Gate**: Determines what to output from memory
- **Cell State**: Stores long-term information
- **Hidden State**: Carries short-term context
## Key Features

1. **Long-Term Dependency Modeling**
	- Retains relevant information over long sequences
2. **Gated Memory Control**
	- Selectively remembers or forgets data
3. **Stable Training**
	- Mitigates vanishing gradients
4. **Sequence-Aware Forecasting**
	- Effective for historical data analysis
## Business Applications

- **Predictive Maintenance**
	- Anticipates equipment failures from sensor data
- **Demand Forecasting**
	- Aligns production with market trends
- **Energy Management**
	- Forecasts consumption patterns for optimization
- **Sustainability Analytics**
	- Supports environmental impact reduction strategies
