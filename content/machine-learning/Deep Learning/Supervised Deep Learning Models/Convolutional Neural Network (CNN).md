> A **supervised deep learning model** specialized for **visual pattern recognition** using hierarchical spatial features.

- Excels at image classification and object detection through layered feature extraction
## Components

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features using learnable filters
- **Pooling Layers**: Down sample feature maps to reduce dimensionality
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform final classification based on extracted features
- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity
- **Input Preprocessing**: Normalize and reshape image data for model ingestion
## Key Features

1. **Spatial Hierarchy Learning**
	- Captures low-to-high level features across layers
	- Ideal for structured visual data
2. **Translation Invariance**
	- Pooling layers help generalize across spatial shifts
3. **Parameter Sharing**
	- Filters are reused across image regions, reducing complexity
4. **End-to-End Training**
	- Learns directly from raw pixels to output labels
## Business Applications

- **Retail Inventory Management**
	- Detects product categories from shelf images
	- Enables automated stock tracking
- **Drone-Based Audits**
	- Integrates with camera-equipped robots for real-time inventory checks
- **Merchandising Optimization**
	- Uses visual analytics to inform product placement strategies
