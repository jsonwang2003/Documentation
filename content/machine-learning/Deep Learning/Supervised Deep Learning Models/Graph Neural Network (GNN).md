> [!INFO]
> A **deep learning architecture** tailored for **graph-structured data**, enabling **node-level**, **edge-level**, and **graph-level predictions** through **message passing** and **neighborhood aggregation**.

- Extends neural networks to **non-Euclidean domains** like social networks, molecules, and knowledge graphs
- Supports both **supervised** and **semi-supervised** learning paradigms
## Components

- **Node Features**: Initial attributes for each node (e.g., categorical, numerical, textual)
- **Edge Features**: Optional attributes for edges (e.g., weights, types)
- **Graph Structure**: Encodes connectivity via adjacency matrix or edge list
- **Message Passing Layers**: Aggregate and update node embeddings from neighbors
- **Graph Pooling**: Converts node-level embeddings into graph-level representations
- **Readout Function**: Produces final prediction (classification or regression)
## Key Features

1. **Message Passing Mechanism**
	- Nodes exchange information with neighbors
	- Embeddings are iteratively updated across layers
2. **Topology-Aware Learning**
	- Captures both local and global graph structures
	- Learns from connectivity patterns and node/edge features
3. **Graph Convolutional Layers**
	- Generalize CNNs to graphs using adjacency-based filtering
4. **Graph-Level Pooling**
	- Aggregates node embeddings into a single vector
	- Enables graph classification tasks
5. **Transferability Across Domains**
	- Applicable to molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and more
## Business Applications

- **Drug Discovery**
	- Predict molecular properties from chemical graph structures
- **Fraud Detection**
	- Analyze transaction networks for anomalous patterns
- **Social Network Analysis**
	- Identify communities, influencers, or predict user behavior
- **Recommendation Systems**
	- Model user-item interactions as bipartite graphs
- **Knowledge Graph Completion**
	- Infer missing relationships between entities
