title: Unsupervised Deep Learning Models
---
> [!INFO]
> Unsupervised Deep Learning refers to neural network-based methods that learn patterns, structures, or representations from **unlabeled data**. These models aim to discover hidden structure, reduce dimensionality, or generate new data without explicit supervision.

## Overview

Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised deep learning does not rely on labeled input-output pairs. Instead, it focuses on learning from the data's internal structure—such as correlations, clusters, or latent representations. These models are foundational in tasks like:

- Feature learning  
- Dimensionality reduction  
- Generative modeling  
- Anomaly detection  
- Representation learning

Unsupervised deep learning is often used as a **pretraining step**, a **data compression tool**, or a **generative engine** in hybrid systems.

## Included Models

- ### [[Autoencoders]]
> Learns to compress and reconstruct input data. Useful for dimensionality reduction, denoising, and anomaly detection.

- ### [[Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)]]
> Consists of a generator and discriminator in a minimax game. Used for realistic data generation, image synthesis, and augmentation.

- ### [[Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)]]
> Topology-preserving neural networks that project high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional grid. Useful for clustering, visualization, and exploratory analysis.

## Key Concepts

- **Latent Representations**: Compressed or abstract features learned from raw data  
- **Reconstruction Loss**: Measures how well the model can reproduce input data  
- **Generative Modeling**: Learns to generate new samples from learned distributions  
- **Clustering and Embedding**: Groups similar data points or maps them to lower-dimensional spaces  
- **Self-Supervision**: Uses internal signals (e.g., masked inputs) to create pseudo-labels for training

## Applications

- Image compression and denoising  
- Text embedding and topic modeling  
- Anomaly detection in sensor or transaction data  
- Pretraining for downstream supervised tasks  
- Synthetic data generation for simulation or augmentation
