> Architectures that **combine different types of learning paradigms or model components** to leverage the strengths of each. These hybrids are designed to improve performance, interpretability, and adaptabilityâ€”especially in complex or data-constrained environments.

- Fusion Enhances 
	- predictive performance adaptability
	- the interpretability across diverse data types
	- problem domains
## Architectural Combinations

- [[Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)|Convolutional Neural Networks]]: Extract **spatial features** from image or grid-like data
- [[Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)|Recurrent Neural Networks]] / [[Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)|Long Short-Term Memory Networks]]: Model sequential or temporal dependencies
- [[Transformer|Transformers]]: Capture **long-range contextual relationships** in text or sequences
- [[Graph Neural Network (GNN)]]: Represent relational structures and graph-based data
- [[machine-learning/Supervised Learning/Classification Models|Classical Machine Learning]]: Provide interpretability and structured decision logic
