title: Reinforced Deep Learning Models
---
>[!INFO]
> This section covers **deep reinforcement learning (DRL)** algorithms that combine **neural networks** with **reinforcement learning principles** to solve complex decision-making tasks in high-dimensional environments.

## Overview

Reinforced Deep Learning Models leverage deep architectures to approximate policies, value functions, or both. These models are especially effective in environments with:

- **Continuous or discrete action spaces**
- **Sparse or delayed rewards**
- **High-dimensional state representations**

They are commonly used in robotics, game AI, autonomous systems, and industrial control.

## Included Models

- ### [[Deep Q-Network (DQN)]]
> A value-based method that uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function. Introduced experience replay and target networks for stability.

- ### [[Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)]]
> An off-policy actor-critic algorithm for continuous action spaces. Combines deterministic policy gradients with Q-learning.

- ### [[Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)]]
> A policy optimization algorithm that balances exploration and stability using clipped surrogate objectives.

## Key Concepts

- **Policy Networks**: Learn to map states to actions  
- **Value Networks**: Estimate expected future rewards  
- **Exploration Strategies**: Balance between trying new actions and exploiting known ones  
- **Replay Buffers**: Store past experiences for off-policy learning  
- **Target Networks**: Stabilize training by decoupling updates  
- **Gradient-Based Optimization**: Used to update neural parameters
